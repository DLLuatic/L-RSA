# l_rsa
Extendable tool for analyzing RSA Attacks based on public information, written in Rust. **Work in progress.**

## TODO
* Add various sample attacks
  * General number field sieve
* Add analytic tools
  * Time analysis
  * Memory analysis (?)
* Add efficient system for adding new attacks
* Add a simple front-end
