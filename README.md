# l_rsa
Extendable tool for analyzing RSA Attacks based on public keys, written in Rust. Work in progress.

## TODO
* Add various sample attacks
  * Wiener's attack
  * Coppersmith attack
  * General number field sieve
* Add analytic tools
  * Time analysis
  * Memory analysis (?)
* Add sample RSA keypairs
* Add efficient system for adding new attacks
* Add a simple front-end
